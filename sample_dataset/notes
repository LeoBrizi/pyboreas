lidar frame z axis flipped? even with respect to transform_data_to_sensor_frame() in andrew's repo
how to run andrew's code:
    - run visualize_labels.py
    - first .json is the point cloud data json
    - "labels.json" should be "sample_labels.json"
    - "idk.jpg" is image save path (leave blank for visualization window)

in the end we want everything in the lidar frame

Visualizer architecture
    User provides which track and which timestep to visualize
    Also provides render options
